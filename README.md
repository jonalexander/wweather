## wweather

Quickly compare the upcoming weather forecast for 4 separate locations. Purely front-end application built with Javascript and jQuery.

### Why?

Every weekend I compare a handful of places before I leave the city to see where the best weather will be.

### Domain Modeling

#### Classes
1. Grid - a container that holds 4 location objects
2. Location - represents a zipcode determined by user input, comprised of multiple day objects
3. Day - represents a single day's weather forecast for a given zipcode
